# CRUD Flask Application 🐉

This is a basic Web Application designed to connect to a MySQL database to modify, add, and delete data. It offers an easy-to-use interface while following the RESTful architecture. 

## Getting Started:

### ⭐You can begin by downloading all of this project's dependencies by running this command from your terminal:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### OR... you can download everything manually by following these steps:

#### STEP 1: Firstly, you should create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies and avoid version conflicts. You can do this by running the following command from your terminal. 

` virtualenv -p python3 env` or  `python3 -m venv env`

#### Alternatively, if in VS Code, you can click on 'View' > 'Command Palette...' > 'Python: Create Environment' > 'Venv'

#### STEP 2: Next, you should activate your virtual environment by running the following command:
` . env/Scripts/activate `

#### STEP 3: After activating your Venv you can now download Flask by running this command:  
`pip install flask`

#### STEP 4: Download the Python MySQL Connector to connect to MySQL by running this command:

` pip install mysql-connector-python`

#### You should also download Bootstrap and extract files to your project directory by following this link:

#### Once you have downloaded all these packages/dependencies, you are ready to go!
